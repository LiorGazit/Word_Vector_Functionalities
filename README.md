# Word Vector Functionalities
This repo has a set of code chunks that leverage the associations between word vectors.

Go to the [Notebook](https://github.com/LiorGazit/Word_Vector_Functionalities/blob/master/word_vector_functionalities.ipynb) so to read about the value of **word vectors** for predictive text analytics, and for some examples and visualizations.
